Currently, the page has three main tabs: Overlap, Project Comparison, and Project Revenue.

## Page Breakdown

### Overlap

#### Overview
Overlap refers to the overlap of holders between two communities. This gives users
essential information on the momentum between communities, and their digital borders.
For instance, if overlap of Deadfellaz and Degenz is 500, that means there are 500 Deadfellaz holders
that also hold at least one Degenz NFT.

you will be able to see a historical line chart of the number of overlaps between the two 
collections, and the title will show you the most recent overlap count.
You can click the back button [orange box] to choose a different primary collection.
