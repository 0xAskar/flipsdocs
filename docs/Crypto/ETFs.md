Bitcoin ETFs are investment funds that replicate the price of Bitcoin and are traded on stock exchanges. They provide investors with the opportunity to gain exposure to Bitcoin's performance without the need to own the cryptocurrency directly. ETFs follow the price of Bitcoin, are listed on exchanges, offer ease of trading similar to shares and are custodied to ensure asset protection.
