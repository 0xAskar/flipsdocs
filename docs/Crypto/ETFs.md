Bitcoin ETFs are investment funds that replicate the price of Bitcoin and are traded on stock exchanges. They provide investors with the opportunity to gain exposure to Bitcoin's performance without the need to own the cryptocurrency directly. ETFs follow the price of Bitcoin, are listed on exchanges, offer ease of trading similar to shares and are custodied to ensure asset protection.

On this page, you can view the volume of ETFs over 24 hours or 7 days, along with the Ticker, price, volume over the 24 or 7 day period, and net assets. This is a useful tool for monitoring the market activity and liquidity of Bitcoin ETFs. The introduction of Bitcoin ETFs aims to provide a more regulated and accessible option for institutional and retail investors.
